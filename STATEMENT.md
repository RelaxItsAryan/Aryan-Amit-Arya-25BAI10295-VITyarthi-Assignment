#  COVID-19 Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Title

**COVID-19 Detection using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Classification Algorithms**

-----

##  Problem Statement

This project addresses the critical need for **swift and reliable diagnosis** of the highly contagious **COVID-19** virus. We harness the power of **Machine Learning (ML)** to develop a system for early detection. The core methodology involves:

1.  Analyzing readily available COVID-19 data.
2.  Comparing the **accuracies** of various classification models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Naive Bayes).
3.  Selecting the **best-performing algorithm** to build the final predictive model.

The goal is to create an efficient system that predicts a person's COVID-19 status based on input features, thereby assisting in preventative measures and resource allocation.

## Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is focused on the modeling and classification aspect of COVID-19 detection:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Sourcing and cleaning a relevant public dataset (e.g., patient symptoms, lab reports, or demographic information) for training ML models.

Algorithm Implementation and Comparison: Implementing and training multiple classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) on the processed dataset.

Performance Evaluation: Rigorously evaluating the models based on key metrics, primarily accuracy, to determine the best-performing classifier.

Final Model Development: Developing the final, optimized predictive model using the superior algorithm.

Output: The final output is a trained, validated machine learning model and a script capable of making binary predictions (Positive/Negative) on new, unseen data.

The project explicitly excludes:

Developing a full-scale clinical application or integrating with hospital infrastructure.

The collection of new, primary patient data.

Advanced deep learning models (the focus is on comparative analysis of classical ML).

##  Technologies/Tools Used

This project relies on standard data science and machine learning libraries in a Python environment:

  * **Programming Language:** **Python 3.x**
  * **Core Libraries:** **NumPy** (for numerical operations) and **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis).
  * **Machine Learning Framework:** **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** (for implementing KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, model training, and evaluation).
  * **Visualization:** **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for data exploration and results plotting).
  * **Environment Management:** Recommended use of **Conda** or **venv** (Python virtual environment).

## Target Users

The primary target users for the output of this project include:

Healthcare Administrators and Public Health Officials: To gain quick insights into potential outbreaks and resource needs based on computational predictions.

Medical Researchers and Data Scientists: To serve as a benchmark or foundational model for further research into COVID-19 diagnostics.

Clinicians and Screening Centers (Indirectly): To provide a rapid, non-invasive triage tool to prioritize individuals for definitive (e.g., PCR) testing.

Students and Educators: As an illustrative case study in applying machine learning to real-world biomedical problems.
